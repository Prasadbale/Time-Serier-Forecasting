# Time Series Forecasting with Python


## Introduction
This repository contains code and resources for time series forecasting using Python. Time series forecasting is a crucial component in various domains, such as finance, sales, and weather prediction. This project aims to provide practical examples and tools to help you understand and implement time series forecasting techniques.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for time series data
- Implementation of popular time series forecasting models:
  - ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
  - Exponential Smoothing methods
  - Prophet
  - Neural Prophet
- Evaluation and performance metrics for forecasting models
- Interactive Jupyter Notebooks for learning and experimentation

## Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended for interactive exploration)
